# Project Overview

Project Name: Meme Pizza Time Machine

Description: A web application that combines a Meme Time Machine with a simulated pizza ordering system. Users can explore popular memes from specific dates or events and then "order" a pizza inspired by that meme from our fictional pizzeria.

Features:

*   Meme Time Machine:
    *   Date Selection: Users can select a specific date (Year, Month/Year, or Full Date). I'll default to Full Date selection for maximum control.
    *   Meme Categories: Filter memes by category (Animals, Pop Culture, Politics).
    *   Meme Display: Displays popular memes from the selected date and category.
*   Mocked Pizza Ordering System:
    *   Meme-Inspired Pizzas: Each meme will have a corresponding pizza with a funny name related to the meme (e.g., "Doge Pizza" with extra cheese, "Distracted Boyfriend Pizza" with three toppings).
    *   Pizza Customization: Allow basic customization like size and crust (all mocked).
    *   Order Summary: A simulated order summary page.
    *   "Delivery" Confirmation: A fun confirmation message (e.g., "Your meme-inspired pizza is on its way!").

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
